                This was my first job at the University and proved to be quite fitting as
                I usually help my classmates with their coursework, so making a job out of seemed
                like the right thing to do. I really enjoyed my time as a tutor as i met a lot of amazing people and learnt how various
                people take in information. I also noticed that those students who were struggling with their classes 
                did not utilize the University's resources such as the online practice question or the college librarly. This helped me realize
                that practice is vital especially for a subject like Mathematics.
